//! Rust-side matching for plugin `OutputWatcher`s.
//!
//! Watchers used to be matched entirely in the WebView: every PTY line was
//! ANSI-stripped and run through every registered `RegExp` on the same thread
//! that paints the terminal (audit finding F3). The matching is pure text work
//! with no DOM dependency, so it moves here.
//!
//! Four rules keep that split honest:
//!
//! * **Rust is the only line assembler.** The WebView no longer reassembles
//!   lines from raw chunks. Two independent assemblers meant a line that began
//!   before a watcher registered and ended after it was split between them and
//!   seen by neither. [`StreamLines`] runs even with no watcher registered, so
//!   its trailing partial is always warm when one appears.
//! * **The cleaner is a port, not an approximation.** [`clean_line`] mirrors
//!   `src/utils/stripAnsi.ts` pattern-for-pattern and applies the same backtick
//!   strip the frontend used to apply, so both sides see the same text.
//! * **Rust may over-match, never under-match.** The frontend re-runs the real
//!   `RegExp` on every flagged line to build the `RegExpExecArray` the plugin
//!   API promises, so a Rust false positive is filtered there. A false
//!   *negative* is invisible and permanent — hence [`to_portable_pattern`],
//!   which rewrites the ECMAScript character-class escapes whose Rust meaning
//!   is narrower, and rejects what it cannot express.
//! * **A pattern we cannot express is not our problem to guess at.** Rejected
//!   watchers keep matching in the WebView, which is told to expect every line
//!   for as long as one is registered.
//!
//! Known accepted divergence: a pattern that *counts* UTF-16 code units of
//! astral characters (`/^.{2}$/` against an emoji) matches in JavaScript and
//! not in Rust. Rewriting quantifier semantics is not worth it; the case has
//! no plausible watcher.
